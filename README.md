# Large Language Model (LLM) metadata tabulation

This repository intends to store useful metadata for popular LLMs.
This list was started because I was annoyed at the lack of transparency regarding e.g. when a specific model was made available, when certain snapshots were released, when they were discontinued, etc.

## Dates

All time related dates are reported here in format YYYY-MM-DD, for ease for algorithm-based sorting.

## Fields and definitions

To be added.

## Releases

These tabulations are made availabe as csv/tsv. File format follows structure:

LLMmetadata_YYYY-MM-DD.{csv,tsv} for a list generated at given time,
or LLMmetadata_latest.{csv,tsv} for the latest working version.

### 2025-05-12

Initial fields.
